# Dream Engine 3 cometh

### Introduction

The last time I updated Dream Engine 2, I wasn't aware of all the coding standards. However this time I want to improve Dream Engine 3 to make it even simpler than last time. I will write the entire thing in portable C++ without much C++11 intervention. 

### Plans

    - Multiple backgrounds
    - Pixel Mode
    - Proper scaling and rotation
    - Better structuring of code

### Final Deployment
